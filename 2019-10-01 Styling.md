# Styling React

This weekend I went through a few options for styling my rss feeder website. Somehow I need to attach css to the divs my react components render.



Here's a simple react component that I'll use as an example for following stuff:

```react
// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>Click the button below to sign up:</p>
      <button onClick={props.onSignup}>Sign Up</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

```



Not too much going on here. All react components are just functions that take in arguments ('props') and return HTML. In this case, `MyComponent` renders a div, with some text, and a signup button. It takes in a prop `onSignup`, whatever function called when the button is clicked.



## Traditional CSS

If you had a react app that was just _this_, it would be pretty ugly: https://cl.ly/faf9c61c45ea

In traditional websites, you just have a `whatever.css` file with some styles, and add that to your site. We can do this in react too:

```css
/* style.css */

h1 {
  color: red;
}

.my-button {
  background: blue;
  width: 100px;
}
```



How do we use that style file in our react component? You simply import it in javascript (this just like... works), and add the appropriate class names to what your react component renders. Here I add that `style.css` file to my react component from before and add the class name `my-button` to my button html:

```react
// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import 'style.css';

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>Click the button below to sign up:</p>
      <button className="my-button" onClick={props.onSignup}>Sign Up</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```



However, what if we run into the following situation. We want to be able to change the color of this signup button dynamically. We'd need to add a class for our newly colored button to our style, and change the classname on the button based on the color. Like so:

```css
/* style.css */

h1 {
  color: red;
}

.my-button {
  width: 100px;
}

.my-button.blue {
  background: blue;
}

.my-button.red {
  background: red;
}
```

```react
// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import 'style.css';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const colorClass = props.color || 'blue'; // blue default
  const buttonClass = 'my-button ' + colorClass;
  
  return (
  	<div>
    	<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p>Click the button below to sign up:</p>
      <button className={buttonClass} onClick={props.onSignup}>Sign Up</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```



Look at the line for `buttonClass`. We need to construct the className string with some logic for each different case. What if we also had dynamic text size, width, etc. It would get pretty messy. This is why "CSS _in_ JS" solutions were invented.



## CSS within JS

We want our CSS to be dynamic. Instead of having CSS in a separate file, we want to have CSS within our JS files so we can have logic around it more easily.

There are multiple solutions for this, the most popular is called 'styled components'. https://www.styled-components.com/

This allows one to define their css styles right within a js file without importing:

```react
// MyComponent.js

import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Heading = styled.h1`
	color: red;
`;

const SignupButton = styled.button`
	width: 100px;
	background: ${props => props.color};
`;

function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<Heading>Welcome to my website</Heading>
      <p>Click the button below to sign up:</p>
      <SignupButton color={props.color} onClick={props.onSignup}>Sign Up</SignupButton>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```



See how we included everything in one file? We can declare _styled_ components with the `styled` keyword, and use them in our _react_ components. We can pass properties from our react component into our styled components to make them dynamic. Notice how we pass in the color prop from `MyComponent` into `SignupButton`:

`<SignupButton color={props.color}`

which then gets used within SignupButton to make its color dynamic:

```
const SignupButton = styled.button`
	width: 100px;
	background: ${props => props.color};
`;
```

There are alternatives to styled components, though the differences are minor. Another lib "emotion js" is nearly identical, but has a few small differences. It's _slightly_ faster (maybe), has a smaller library size, but is also a smaller community. I decided to just stick with styled components.

 

## Style Librarys

So we have styles for the page! And there are many styles to make:

- make buttons look good, react when hovered over etc.
- have different levels of typography (big title, medium title, small title)
- have the page and text on it respond to screen size (make things smaller on mobile)
- make things 'accessible'. Disabled users will be using screen readers and navigate your site with a screen reader. Your styles need to be compatible.

Solving all these problems from scratch is a bit daunting for a new project. There are libraries of components that already solve these problems, if we want to use them out of the box. The question is, should we?



### Good bad and ugly of component libraries

Here are some examples of popular react component libraries (there are many many others):

- Material Design: https://material-ui.com/
- Bootstrap: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts
- Grommet: https://v2.grommet.io/

There are many pros to using a component library, but summed up: you can lego piece together UIs right away, and not need to do everything up front. You can create a good enough MVP. Component libraries often include complicated components that would be a pain to implement from scratch, like calendars. Component libraries usually are accessible, responsive, and are visually consistent so you don't need to handle that.



There are also big downsides to a component library, especially if you don't choose wisely. 

1. Component libraries are often _bloated_. They tend to include everything and the kitchen sink. Jack of all trades, master of none. You will probably not use everything in the library. Even the components you do use could be large in download size. This is usually to make them fit many use cases, but if you're using only 1 use case then you're making your site bigger for no reason.
2. Component libraries are often _opinionated_. They have a way of doing things, and if you don't want to do things that way too bad. "I want my buttons to have this spacing". Whelp, looks like you need to override everything. 
3. Component libraries are often _boring_. While component libraries are consistent, they usually are consistently _boring_. Not everyone wants a black and white and blue webpage. The ease of use of component libraries means that your site will not look unique. "material design" and "bootstrap" are examples of this.



### Middle Ground

So rolling things from scratch ensures you have things that look and work the way you want them to, but at the expense of doing a ton of work making things responsive, accessible, etc. Is there a middle ground?

In my mind a good component library satisfies the following:

1. It's _light weight_. It doesn't try to do everything. I really just need the basic starting styles for things like buttons, text boxes, headers. I don't need a bunch of crazy components right out the gate. If I need a complicated component, I'll roll my own or use a standalone library that _just_ makes that component. In that case you know it'll be good, rather than using a medicore one within a huge library.
2. It's _unopinionated_. I want to be able to use the component library as a base and build on top of it with my own stuff. I should be able to override and theme nearly everything easily.
3. It's _supported_. React is changing often, I want to go with a popular ish library so I don't get stuck with an out of date thing. A supported library also means having good documentation, so it's easy to look up how things work.



### Options

I looked at a ton of options. There are many listed here: https://github.com/styled-components/awesome-styled-components



The three example libs I listed way above were among those I looked at. None of them passed my 'lightweight' / 'unopinionated' / 'boring' test. Mostly they were too big, and difficult to override if I want to move to a custom look. 



On option I liked was called bulma: https://bulma.io/ . Bulma is small, simple, no complicated components at all just a simple starting point for styling.

This is not a react component library but a css library. Essentially just a single big css file. I'm using styled components, so I don't want straight up css files. Luckily there's a styled components implementation of bulma: https://bloomer.js.org/#/

Downside here is I was having trouble overriding styles when using bloomer... it's complicated but long story short it's a pain to use.



I ended up going with this lib, rebass: [https://rebassjs.org](https://rebassjs.org/)

It's a bit heavier than I had liked, but it's well supported. It has a whole ecosystem of styling stuff called "styled system": https://styled-system.com/ecosystem. This was cool to see, knowing I could use all these tools together if I wanted. If not, I can stick with one lib. 

It's also easy to get started, with good documentation: https://rebassjs.org/getting-started
